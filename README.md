# TBC-sosr
code for "Joint Optimization for SSIM-Based CTU-Level Bit Allocation and Rate Distortion Optimization" Li, Yang, and Xuanqin Mou. IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting (2021).

## update
We have implemented our SOSR scheme on VTM13.0 for H.266 versatile video coding standard. The current 0.9 version does not perform parameter optimization for VTM. Later we may release an optimized 1.0 version. However, the current encoder is ready to be used for performance comparison.
